## How to use ##
Before compiling the project, you must have a valid [anilist API client identifier and secret key](http://anilist-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html#creating-a-client). Once you have that, you need to set the ```ANILIST_CLIENT_ID``` and ```ANILIST_CLIENT_SECRET``` constants to these values in the ```config.py``` file.
